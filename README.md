# Recursive Fibonacci and Merge Sort Project

This project contains implementations of the Fibonacci sequence and Merge Sort algorithm, both using recursion.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- A text editor, such as Visual Studio Code
- A recent version of Node.js (if running JavaScript code)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your text editor.

## Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In this project, we implement a recursive function to generate the Fibonacci sequence.

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is an efficient, stable sorting algorithm that makes use of the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It works by dividing the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), and then repeatedly merging sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
